### What is Bias in a Linear Model?
The **bias** term (`b` in this case) is an additional parameter in a linear model equation, defined as:
```bash

output=w⋅x+b

```

where:
- `w` is the **weight** (or slope) that scales the input `x`.
- `b` is the **bias** (or intercept), a constant value added to the output after multiplying `x` by `w`.

### Why Do We Use Bias?
The bias allows the model to shift the output value up or down, independently of the input `x`. This is important because, without the bias term, the model output would always pass through the origin (0,0) when the input is zero. In many real-world cases, the relationship between inputs and outputs does not pass through the origin, so bias helps capture this flexibility.

### Code Example and Bias Impact
Let's break down the results you should see when different values are passed to the model:

1. **Output when `x = 0`**:
   ```python
   print(linear_model(tf.constant([0.0])))
   ```
   Since `x = 0`, the output should be:
  ```bash
  w⋅0+b=b

  ```
   This means the output will be equal to `b`. Given `b = 1.0`, the output will be `1.0` even when there is no input effect. This highlights how the bias shifts the output independently of the input.

2. **Output when `x = [1.0, 2.0, 5.0]`**:
   ```python
   print(linear_model(tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 5.0])))
   ```
   For each value of `x`, the output is calculated as:
   ```bash
   output=w⋅x+b
    ```
   With `w = 2.0` and `b = 1.0`, this means:
   - For \( x = 1.0 \): Output = \( 2 * 1.0 + 1.0 = 3.0 \)
   - For \( x = 2.0 \): Output = \( 2 * 2.0 + 1.0 = 5.0 \)
   - For \( x = 5.0 \): Output = \( 2 * 5.0 + 1.0 = 11.0 \)

   This demonstrates that the bias term (`b`) shifts all outputs upwards by 1 unit, regardless of the scaling effect of `w`.

### Summary
The bias term is crucial because it allows the model to adjust its output even when the input is zero. It adds **flexibility** to the model by enabling it to fit a wider range of data patterns, especially those that don’t pass through the origin. This shift capability helps in capturing relationships between input and output that have an inherent offset, thus improving model accuracy and robustness in practical applications.
