# Sonar Dataset Classification Using Perceptron with Softmax Activation

## Project Overview

This project focuses on binary classification using a neural network with a softmax layer on the Sonar dataset. The Sonar dataset classifies sonar signals bouncing off either rocks or metal cylinders. Each feature in the dataset represents sonar intensity in different frequency bands, enabling the model to distinguish patterns specific to each object type. We use TensorFlow to build, train, and evaluate the model.

## Dataset Overview

- **Sonar Dataset**: Contains 208 samples with 60 features each.
- **Features**: Each feature represents a sonar signal frequency response, aiding in the classification of the object that reflected the sonar signal.
- **Target Labels**: 
  - 'R' for rock.
  - 'M' for metal cylinder.

This binary classification challenge helps assess how well a neural network with a softmax layer can distinguish nuanced frequency patterns across multiple features.
